# Introduction
In this project, I have create a Tictac game using C program.Tic-Tac-Toe game is very popular and is fairly simple by itself. It is a computer based game for two players X and O. They take turns marking the spaces in the 3 x 3 grid with X and O alternatively.The player who succeeds in placing three successive marks either in horizontal, diagonal or vertical wins the game.

# Objective
The main objective of the project is to learn C program.

# Features
1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
5. Provides user interaction with the computer, provides taking turns.

# State of art 
   Computer itself makes a move as per the user's previous move.

## Ageing time
   Can be overcome within short time.
   
##  Ageing feature
   Can be overcomed by advanced features.

# 4W's and 1 H's
